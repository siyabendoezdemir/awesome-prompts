This prompt is designed to generate personalized re-engagement messages for inactive SaaS users. It creates motivational messages that encourage users to return to the platform while maintaining a friendly, non-pushy tone.

## Prompt Structure

<Prompt content={`
You are an AI tasked with creating personalized progress reminders and motivational nudges for users who haven't logged into a SaaS platform for a certain period. Your goal is to craft a message that encourages the user to return to the platform and continue their progress.

First, you will be provided with information about the SaaS platform:
<saas_info>
{{SAAS_INFO}}
</saas_info>

Next, you will receive information about the user:
<user_info>
{{USER_INFO}}
</user_info>

The number of days since the user's last login is:
<days_since_login>
{{DAYS_SINCE_LOGIN}}
</days_since_login>

Using this information, create a personalized reminder message for the user. Follow these guidelines:
1. Address the user by their first name if available.
2. Reference specific features or benefits of the SaaS platform that might interest the user based on their information.
3. Mention the number of days since their last login, but frame it positively (e.g., "We've missed you!" rather than "You haven't logged in for X days").
4. Include a specific call-to-action, encouraging them to log in and continue their progress.
5. Keep the tone friendly, encouraging, and motivational without being pushy.
6. Limit the message to 2-3 short paragraphs.

Before writing the message, use the <scratchpad> tags to brainstorm key points you want to include based on the user and SaaS information provided.
After your scratchpad, write your final message within <reminder_message> tags.

Remember to personalize the message based on the user's information and the specific features of the SaaS platform. Do not include any placeholder text or variables in your final message - it should read as a complete, personalized message ready to be sent to the user.

## Variables

The prompt uses three main variables that need to be replaced:

1. `{{SAAS_INFO}}`: Information about the SaaS platform
   - Should include: platform name, key features, unique selling points
   - Example: "ProductivityPro is a task management platform featuring automated workflows, team collaboration tools, and advanced analytics"

2. `{{USER_INFO}}`: User-specific information
   - Should include: name, usage history, preferred features
   - Example: "Name: John Smith; Most used features: workflow automation, team chat; Role: Project Manager"

3. `{{DAYS_SINCE_LOGIN}}`: Numeric value
   - Simple integer representing days since last login
   - Example: "14"

## XML Tags

The prompt utilizes several XML-style tags for structure:

- `<saas_info>`: Contains platform information
- `<user_info>`: Contains user information
- `<days_since_login>`: Contains inactivity duration
- `<scratchpad>`: Used for brainstorming key message points
- `<reminder_message>`: Contains the final message
