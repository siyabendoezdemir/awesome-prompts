## The Prompt

<Prompt content={`
You are an AI tasked with optimizing pricing plans for a usage-based API service. Your goal is to analyze user patterns and recommend optimized pricing plans that are cost-effective for heavy users, potentially reducing support inquiries on pricing.

First, review the current pricing plans:
<current_pricing_plans>
{{CURRENT_PRICING_PLANS}}
</current_pricing_plans>

Now, analyze the following user data, which includes information on API request volumes and frequencies for various users:
<user_data>
{{USER_DATA}}
</user_data>

To complete this task, follow these steps:

1. Analyze the user data to identify patterns in API usage, focusing on:
   - Volume of requests per user
   - Frequency of requests (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Any notable spikes or trends in usage

2. Based on your analysis, recommend optimized pricing plans that:
   - Are cost-effective for heavy users
   - Encourage increased usage where appropriate
   - Simplify the pricing structure if possible

3. For each recommended pricing plan, provide a justification that includes:
   - How it benefits heavy users
   - Potential impact on reducing support inquiries
   - Any potential drawbacks or considerations

4. If applicable, suggest any additional features or tiers that could be added to the pricing structure to better accommodate user needs.

Present your analysis and recommendations in the following format:

<analysis>
[Provide a summary of your analysis of user patterns here]
</analysis>

<recommendations>
[List each recommended pricing plan here, with a brief description]
</recommendations>

<justifications>
[Provide justifications for each recommended pricing plan here]
</justifications>

<additional_suggestions>
[If applicable, provide any additional suggestions for improving the pricing structure here]
</additional_suggestions>

Remember to base all your recommendations on the data provided and ensure they align with the goal of optimizing pricing for heavy users while potentially reducing support inquiries.
