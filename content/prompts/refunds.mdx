```

### Output:
```
Dear [Customer Name],

Thank you for reaching out about your recent purchase of [Course Name] (Order #12345). I understand that the course wasn't quite what you expected, and I appreciate you bringing this to our attention.

I've reviewed your request and can confirm that it falls within our 14-day refund window for unused digital products. Before processing the refund, I'd love to understand what specific aspects of the course didn't meet your expectations. We might have additional resources or alternative courses that better align with your goals.

However, if you're certain about the refund, I can process that for you today. The refund will be issued to your original payment method and should appear within 3-5 business days.

Would you be open to sharing more about what you were looking for? This would help us either find a better solution for you or improve our course descriptions for future students.

Best regards,
[AI Assistant Name]
